# Global Rules

This set of guidelines ensures consistency, clarity, performance, and maintainability across all languages and projects. Always apply these principles to produce clean, understandable, and efficient code.

## Code Style and Readability

1. **Clarity Over Brevity**:
   - Favor understandable code over clever tricks.
   - Prioritize legibility and maintainability over saving a few lines.
2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive, self-explanatory names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
   - Follow language-specific naming conventions (e.g., `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for JavaScript) and remain consistent throughout the codebase.
3. **Consistent Formatting**:
   - Adhere to a uniform indentation style, spacing, and line width.
   - Use automated tools (linters, formatters) to enforce consistency and reduce manual overhead.
4. **Comments That Add Value**:
   - Write comments to explain the "why" behind complex logic, not just the "what."
   - Remove or avoid redundant comments that restate the obvious.
5. **Small, Single-Responsibility Functions**:
   - Keep functions concise and focused on doing one thing well.
   - Break larger functionalities into smaller, reusable units that are easier to test and maintain.

## Architecture and Modularity

1. **Encapsulation of Complexity**:
   - Hide complex logic behind clear interfaces or modules.
   - Present a simple, well-documented API to callers while keeping internals flexible and interchangeable.
2. **Decouple Components**:
   - Design modules with minimal direct knowledge of each other's implementations.
   - Use interfaces, abstract classes, or dependency injection to reduce coupling and improve testability and flexibility.
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**:
   - Factor out repetitive patterns into shared functions or classes.
   - Refactor early and often to prevent code drift and bloat over time.

## Error Handling and Testing

1. **Fail Fast, Fail Loud**:
   - Validate assumptions early, return or throw errors as soon as something unexpected happens.
   - Provide clear error messages that help identify the root cause quickly.
2. **Testability as a Priority**:
   - Write code that is easy to test in isolation.
   - Separate pure logic from side effects, use dependency injection, and ensure complex logic resides in testable units.
3. **Thorough Input Validation**:
   - Check all inputs for correctness, sanity, and security risks before processing.
   - Guard against malformed data, null references, or out-of-bound values.

## Performance and Resource Management

1. **Appropriate Data Structures and Algorithms**:
   - Choose data structures and algorithms best suited for the problem to ensure reasonable time and space complexity.
   - Opt for clarity first, and only optimize further if and when performance profiling indicates a need.
2. **Avoid Premature Optimization**:
   - Start with a clean, readable solution.
   - Measure performance with profiling tools and address hotspots instead of guessing where optimization is needed.
3. **Resource Lifecycle Awareness**:
   - Properly manage memory, file handles, network connections, and other resources.
   - Use language-specific best practices (e.g., RAII, `with` statements, finally blocks) to ensure proper cleanup.
